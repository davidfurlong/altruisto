  <strong>Inform me when I have an opportunity to raise money for charities from my purchase</strong><br>
  <p class="description">Anytime you visit a website of one of our partners you will see a bar at the top of a page giving you an opportunity to raise money for charities just by clicking one button. If you click on that button will be asked to confirm that you want to support altruisto through your purchases on the site you're viewing. After that, <strong>usually between 3-7% of your purchase will be donated to charities we support.</strong></p>

  <p class="description">This option allows you to see a small box containing promotions, coupons, and products that may interest you based on the content of the page that you are viewing. It appears from time to time on the bottom right corner of your browser. <strong>Anytime you decide to buy a suggested product, one of the World's most effective charities receives a portion of a profit from the sale</strong> (the price for you doesn't change). We strive to make it as fast and unintrusive as possible.</p>

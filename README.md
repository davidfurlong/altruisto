#What is altruisto?

It's a browser extension that allows users to raise money for charities through their online shoppings with no extra costs. When a user visits one of our parnters' stores, a special bar is displayed at the top of a website with a button saying "start raising money". After clicking the button, the user needs to confirm the choice and then is redirected back to the store through an affiliate link. When she or he buys something, the commission earned from affiliate program is donated to carefully chosen charities that have been thouroughly researched by GiveWell.org. The charities are: GiveDirectly, Against Malaria Foundation, Schistosomiasis Control Initiative.
